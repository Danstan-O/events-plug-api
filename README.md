# README


# creating a new application

We created a new application that we would use for the 
project

# Generating resources

We ran the different rails generators to be able to generate resources for;

`account information`

`checkout`

`events`

`sessions`

`user_events`

`users`


# Models

We then created the following relationships in our models:
-A `Merchant` has many `Merchandizes`

- A `Merchandize` belongs to a  `Merchant`

- A `Merchandize` has many  `Reviews`

- A `Buyer` has many  `Reviews`

- A `Merchandizes` has many `Buyer` through  `Reviews`

- A `Buyer` has many `Merchandizes` through  `Reviews`

- A `Merchandize` belongs to a  `Merchant`


After that I did the migrations for the database tables that I had created.

# Seeding
I then created the seeds and seeded them to generate data that I was going to use and see if my application was working as expected.

# Validations
I added the following validation to the `Buyer` model:

-A `username`, `password` and `email` were to be present. 

I also added the validation for `Merchandize` where:

- `category` was to be one of the following values 'Men', 'Women', 'Kids', 'Unisex' 

I then added the following validation to the `Merchandize` model:

-A `name`, `password` and `email` were to be present.

- The `email` was also supposed to be unique.



# Routes
I set up the following routes and made sure that they return

 JSON data in the format below along with their 
 
 appropriate HTTP verb.

GET /merchandizes

 It was to return JSON data in the format below:
